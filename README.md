This repository has an auxiliary CEBRA package with extra analysis functions for use with CEBRA.

The two notebooks here can be a quick primer on CEBRA and how to get started with it. The input data is Fiber photometry data from simultaneously recorded neuromodulators in a dynamic foraging task.

Basics.ipynb is an intro to CEBRA and its basic functions.
AIND-Data is an example of how to use CEBRA in analysis (specifically with the fiber photometry data described above)


NB: If you're using these notebooks locally you'll need to download the data folder to be able to run all the analyses. An easy option would be to directly access the Code Ocean Capsule and the access VS Code or another IDE to run the notebooks without donwloading the data.
